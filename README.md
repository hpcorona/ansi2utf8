ansi2utf8
=========

This is a simple command line utility that will help you add the Byte Order Mark of UTF-8 to your XML files.

You just need to put the executable in your folder and run it. It will seek for all the XML files in your current directory and add the BOM to all files that don't have it.

You can also drag and drop a XML file to the executable.

WARNING: This program WILL NOT convert your characters to UTF-8, it will just add the BOM at the start of the file.
